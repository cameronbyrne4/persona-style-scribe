Given your goals and the nature of the application, I recommend a modern, serverless-first stack that prioritizes developer experience and scalability. Your suggestions of Supabase and Tailwind are perfect, and we'll build around that.

Here is the proposed tech stack outline.

### Tech Stack Outline - V1

This stack is designed for rapid development, excellent performance, and low initial operational costs. It separates the frontend (what the user sees) from the backend (our logic and data).

#### 1. Frontend (The Lovable Interface)

* **Framework: Next.js (React)**
    * **Why:** It's the industry standard for building production-grade React applications. We'll get fast performance through its smart rendering strategies (SSR/SSG), a great developer experience with file-based routing, and it's the perfect host for our `shadcn/ui` components.
* **UI Components: `shadcn/ui`**
    * **Why:** As you selected, it provides beautiful, accessible, and unopinionated components. Since we copy-paste the code into our project, we have full control to style and modify them, which is a huge advantage over traditional libraries.
* **Styling: Tailwind CSS**
    * **Why:** It's a dependency for `shadcn/ui` and is the de facto standard for utility-first CSS. It will allow us to rapidly build and style custom components to match our design reference.
* **Data Fetching & State Management: TanStack Query (React Query)**
    * **Why:** This is critical for managing communication with our backend. It simplifies all server state management, expertly handling loading states, error states, and caching of our generation requests. This will make the app feel much more responsive and professional.

#### 2. Backend, Database & Storage (The Engine)

* **Platform: Supabase**
    * **Why:** This is the heart of our backend. It's an all-in-one "Backend as a Service" that provides everything we need, allowing us to move incredibly fast.
    * **Database:** Supabase provides a full **PostgreSQL** database. The schema we designed will be implemented here directly. It's robust, scalable, and trusted.
    * **Authentication:** We'll use **Supabase Auth** to handle Google sign-in. It's secure, simple to implement, and directly meets our PRD requirements.
    * **File Storage:** We will use **Supabase Storage** to securely upload and store the user's writing samples (the PDFs, text files, etc.).
    * **Serverless Logic: Supabase Edge Functions**
        * **Why:** This is where our core "secret sauce" logic will live. These are Deno-based TypeScript functions that can be triggered by our frontend. We will write functions to:
            1.  Parse uploaded documents to extract raw text.
            2.  Fetch a user's style samples from the database.
            3.  Construct the detailed "meta-prompt" for the AI.
            4.  Securely call the AI service API.

#### 3. AI Service (The Creative Mind)

* **Provider: OpenAI or Anthropic**
    * **Why:** To achieve the high-level style replication and RAG analysis we need, we must use a state-of-the-art model.
    * **Recommended Model: GPT-4o (OpenAI) or Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)**. I recommend starting with **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** as it is often lauded for its nuanced understanding of human writing styles and its large context window, which is perfect for our use case.
    * **Implementation:** Our Supabase Edge Function will make a REST API call to the chosen provider, sending our carefully constructed prompt and returning the result to the user.

#### 4. Payments (Future Monetization)

* **Provider: Stripe**
    * **Why:** While not in the MVP, Stripe is the undisputed leader for online payments. When we're ready to add subscription tiers, Supabase Edge Functions can securely handle Stripe webhooks to manage user subscription status. It's the right choice to plan for.

#### 5. Deployment

* **Platform: Vercel**
    * **Why:** Vercel is the company that created Next.js, and their platform is built to host Next.js apps. The developer experience is unmatched. We can connect our code repository (e.g., from GitHub), and Vercel will automatically build and deploy our site on every push. It has a generous free tier perfect for our MVP.
